# Go Algorithms

This repository contains Go implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures. It is designed as a resource for students learning computer science and programming concepts using the Go language.

## Structure

All algorithm implementations are located in the `algorithms/` directory. Each file demonstrates a specific algorithm or data structure with clear, educational code.

### Included Algorithms & Data Structures

- **binary_search.go**: Implementation of binary search for sorted arrays.
- **bubble_sort.go**: Classic bubble sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- **linear_search.go**: Simple linear search for finding elements in arrays.
- **linked_list.go**: Singly linked list data structure with basic operations.
- **queue.go**: Queue data structure (FIFO) with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **recursion.go**: Examples of recursive algorithms (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).
- **stack.go**: Stack data structure (LIFO) with push and pop operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone <your-repo-url>
	cd gopher
	```
2. Run any algorithm example:
	```sh
	go run main.go
	```
	Or run a specific file for testing:
	```sh
	go run algorithms/bubble_sort.go
	```

## Learning Goals

- Understand the logic behind classic algorithms and data structures.
- Practice Go syntax and idioms.
- Experiment with modifying and extending the provided code.
